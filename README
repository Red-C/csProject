This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

we tested lots of different testcase, and fixed the bug if it is appeared. The only limitation is the input have to follow the syntax rules. However, there are memory leaking in the program, because the 
lab1a and 1c might use those data. I already label in the comments
when I allocate memory, and I will free them after lab1a or 1c.
