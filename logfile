[BUG] subshell at the end of input stream, and a newline character
	  after subshell. read_seq can not detect the newline token. 
[FIXED] if the token after right bracket is NEW_LINE, change its
		type to SEQ. the possible token after subshell are || &&
		; NL, but new_line can not appear before || and &&. therfore
		if NL is appearred, it seem as sequence token.
[BUG EXAMPLE]
		(sort < a | cat b - | tr A-Z a-z > c
		 sort -k2 d - < a | uniq -c > e
	     diff a c > f)
