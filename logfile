	modified:   execute-command.c

	[BUG] cannot open commands that not output to stdout(vim, less)
			because execute pipe redirect output of command to write side
			of pipe, which causes commands such as vim and less can not
			output their UI to the place they want.
	[FIXED] execute_command.c 236: this can be optimized, add a parameter 
			to execute_pipe_helper to indicate the top level of pipe 
			command do not redirect the output to the pipe. if commands
			such as less is in middle of pipe, it will not open the 
			UI.
