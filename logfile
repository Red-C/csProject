	[BUG] empty simple command if new_line before right bracket
		  read_command.c: read simple changes the type of the 
	new_line before right bracket to SEQ, which causes read_simple_command
	detect next token is not a word and the queue is not empty; therefore,
	throw exception.
	[FIXED] read_command.c 1043: return null if queue is empty or next
	token is RB, next token is RB means the subshell command tree is 
	completed.
