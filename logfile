[BUG] can not ignore BACK_SLASH
[FIXED] 92: add while loop in next_token_type to eat/ignore all backslash

[BUG] wrong value of error line
[FIXED] 124,300,1104: increase _line after NEW_LINE before it changes type from NEW_LINE to SEQ.

[BUG] return seq command with NULL right child which causes print 
		funtion can not read inside of subshell
[FIXED] 242: return left child rather than return a seq command that
		    has a Null right child, because prefix traversal function 
			will link all non-sequence command; therefore, fixing this
			problem will not affect other things.

[BUG] throw empty command exception if subshell is preceded by multiple
		new_line character(or multiple new_line after special token shou		ld not work too)
[FIXED] 221,334,388: eat new_line at beginning of each read function
